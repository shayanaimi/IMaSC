["[33] Our main result is that the combination of optimal dynamics, i.e., downward transport following a mid-January SSW, and in situ production of NOx due to several moderate SPEs is not necessarily enough to produce a long-term and clearly NOx-dominated effect on stratospheric ozone. Particularly in the case of 2012, (1) the SPEs were only medium size in strength and did not produce enough NOx and (2) the overall production of NOx by particle precipitation in the MLT region was low, leading to relatively low concentrations of NOx being transported down to the stratosphere after the SSW. It should be noted that the cases presented in this paper are from an elongated period of relatively low solar activity. In order to fully understand the NOx connection between the MLT and stratosphere and its inuence on stratospheric ozone levels, periods of high solar activity (for high overall energetic particle precipitation) should be investigated as well. For this, the continuation of middle atmosphere measurements of NOx and ozone is essential.",{"entities":[]}]

["The above sampling and binning procedure must be set into the context of the constraints of instrument sampling imposed by the yaw cycle maneuvers. Figure 1 illustrates the spatial-temporal coverage for the MLS temperature data covering the complete 1 November 199127 October 1994 data interval; as such, it is slightly different than the yaw cycle coverage for any given year. Our time intervals for binning of data in local time are centered on the 15th of each month, and span 36 days at latitudes equatorward of 34, and 72 days at higher latitudes. This ensures 24 h of local time coverage at most latitudes between 80 (for some months inadequate local time coverage occurred near the yaw boundaries at 34). At latitudes poleward of 34 the high-latitude sampling during many months (i.e., January, April, June, November in the Southern Hemisphere, and May, July, October, December in the Northern Hemisphere) consists of 36 continuous days such that they overlap most of the same monthdays as the sampling equatorward of 34. On the other hand, there are some months (i.e., February, March in the Southern Hemisphere, and August, September in the Northern Hemisphere) where the 36 days of highlatitude data coverage are continuous, but are centered near the beginning or end of an adjacent month (i.e., slipped 18 days from midmonth). There are also some months (i.e., May and December in the Southern Hemisphere, and November and January in the Northern Hemisphere), where the 15th of the month falls in the gap between yaw cycles, and about half the local times binned together originate in the previous and following yaw cycles. It is these latter months (in one hemisphere or the other) that may be most subject to aliasing of the type discussed in the appendix. However, the reader is reminded that the results described here are climatological in the sense that they represent multiyear averages. We have chosen to analyze the data in this fashion, rather than on a yaw cycle by yaw cycle basis, in order to obtain a data product that spans both hemispheres up to 80 without alternating data gaps between the yaw cycles. The multiyear averaging utilized here should ameliorate the shortcomings associated with this chosen methodology.",{"entities":[[207,210,"INSTRUMENT"]]}]
["A test run including only the chemistry of solid PSC particles at all temperatures but neglecting the effects of liquid polar stratospheric clouds is also presented (SOLIDS#1; solid yellow curves). This case does not produce as much ozone loss as the reference or LIQUIDS#3 cases, but produces much more ozone loss than the LIQUIDS#1 or LIQUIDS#2 cases. It is important to note that Figure 2 shows that the depletions due to liquid or solid PSCs are not additive. For example, in Antarctica, about half as much ozone depletion as in the reference run is obtained when only solid particles are considered, but when only liquids are considered over the full range of temperatures, results are very close to those of the reference run. Thus, the reference run is not a sum of the two; rather liquid or solid PSCs can each drive substantial heterogeneous chemistry. Hence, such tests cannot determine specic percentages of ozone loss attributable to different types of PSCs in the real world, even if the simplied microphysics package of the model is assumed to be realistic (see further discussion below) and denitrication is included in all cases.",{"entities":[]}]

The WCCOS simulation by Smit and ASOPOS (2014) of a tropical prole estimate a similar range of PO3 values that also maximize around the tropopause (up to ~17%) due to the dominance of the IB/IM term. The main difference is that this term dominates PO3 values throughout the prole, whereas in our study, the ow rate and conversion efciency uncertainty dominate in the stratosphere. Sterling et al. (2017) present PO3 mean proles for April and October at Hilo, Hawaii, and American Samoa (two SHADOZ sites), which we interpret as similar to the seasonal plots shown in Figure 5. Here we observe that their range of PO3 values is similar to ours, that is, maxima at the tropopause (>10%) and minima elsewhere in the prole (~5%). Sterling et al. (2017) show a relative minimum (maximum) in MAM (SON), similar to that shown for Hanoi and Kuala Lumpur (Figures 5e and 5f). In comparison, midlatitude and high-latitude ozonesonde proles from previous studies show that (1) the overall uncertainty is smaller, that is, less than ~10% throughout the prole, (2) the conversion efciency uncertainty term is a signicant contributor to PO3 throughout the prole, and for some sites like Uccle is the dominant uncertainty term, and (3) the impact of the IB/IM term remains an important contributor to PO3 around the tropopause (McMurdo uncertainty analysis; T.

["When the polar vortex forms, the majority of chlorine is present in the form of HCl and the remainder is present in the other important reservoir gas ClONO2 (e.g., Solomon, 1999; Santee et al., 2008). Figure 11 shows the partitioning between the various inorganic chlorine species (Cly). The available amount of Cly is about 2.7 to 3.3 ppb at 54 hPa. The increase of Cly over the winter is due to transport from above. Due to stronger descent in the model in the Northern Hemisphere, Cly increases to values that are about 0.3 ppb higher in the Northern Hemisphere in 2005 than in the Southern Hemisphere in spring 2006, although the initial values are similar. Thus, the chlorine potentially available for ozone depletion in the Northern Hemisphere is increased compared to the Southern Hemisphere. In both hemispheres, the initial mixing ratio of HCl is about 2 ppb at 54 hPa (75 % of Cly) and the initial mixing ratio of ClONO2 is about 0.7 ppb (see also Santee et al., 2008). Cly is produced by photolysis and reaction with O(1D) from chlorouorocarbons (CFCs), hydrochlorouorocarbons (HCFCs) and similar species of mainly anthropogenic origin (e.g., WMO, 2011; Montzka, 2012).

Figure 12b shows that the absolute maximum in the CO gradient is a climatological feature over a broad range of latitudes. Figure 12c shows that the relative maxima and minima in the O3 gradient at and above the tropopause, respectively, are only apparent for latitude bands >40N. The heights of the minima in the O3 gradient above the tropopause are found to increase with increasing latitude, similarly to the relative maxima in the temperature profiles.

Figure 13 shows that absolute maxima in the CO gradients occur at the thermal tropopause throughout both NH and SH midlatitudes. The relation breaks down in the polar regions during winter, and in the SH subtropical jet region during summer. The maximum in the absolute value of the CO gradient indicates that the thermal tropopause represents a localized minimum in vertical mixing within the tropopause region.

["Seasonal cycles at SH high latitudes have a more complex structure than those at the NH mid-latitudes due to generally weaker downwelling in the BrewerDobson circulation and the inuence of Antarctic ozone depletion. As a consequence, the reanalyses have more difculty in capturing the seasonal cycle. At 10 hPa, MERRA-2 shows the best agreement with the observations. CFSR also follows the observations relatively well but overestimates the amplitude of the seasonal cycle, primarily because of values that are too low during May through July. MERRA and JRA-25 are outliers in that they do not contain the strong annual minimum observed during late austral autumn and early winter. At 50 hPa, MERRA and JRA-25 agree better with observations than at 10 hPa, but still underestimate austral springtime ozone depletion. Finally, at 150 hPa, the seasonality in the reanalyses varies widely and is inconsistent with that in the observations, with the exception of MERRA, which produces the most realistic seasonal cycle amplitude.

["Large variability in Antarctic ozone loss has been seen in the last few years (20042013) relative to other winters since 1992 (e.g., Tilmes et al., 2006; Huck et al., 2007; Yang et al., 2006; Santee et al., 2008a). For instance, the winters of 2004, 2010, and 2012 were relatively warm, with minor warmings and, hence, limited ozone loss (Santee et al., 2005; de Laat and van Weele, 2011; WMO, 2014). The rst fortnight of August 2005 was unusually cold and showed a high rate of ozone loss and an unprecedented ozone hole (WMO, 2014). The winter of 2006 was one of the coldest and, hence, the Antarctic vortex experienced the largest ozone hole to date (Santee et al., 2011; WMO, 2014). The winters of 2007, 2009, and 2013 were characterized by average temperatures and, hence, ozone holes of a moderate size (Tully et al., 2008; Kuttippurath et al., 2013). However, the winters of 2008 and 2011 were again very cold and characterized by large ozone holes (Tully et al., 2011; WMO, 2014). Here, we provide a detailed view of these 10 winters in relation to polar processing and the chemistry of ozone loss. In this study, we discuss (i) the interannual variability in ozone loss and chlorine activation and (ii) horizontal, vertical, and seasonal variability in ozone loss in the Antarctic stratosphere during these (2004 2013) winters. We use high-resolution simulations for analyzing the polar processing and interannual changes in ozone loss in detail. Note that the simulations are highly resolved in the lower stratosphere (about 0.5 km between 425 and 550 K) too, to closely study the ozone loss features in those peak ozone loss altitude layers. Additionally, the past 10 winters offer a good opportunity to test the chemical and dynamical processes in numerical models. Furthermore, observations from the Aura microwave limb sounder (MLS) (Froidevaux et al., 2008; Santee et al., 2008b), one of the best satellite instruments currently available for sampling polar vortices, are compared to the model results. Therefore, for the rst time ozone loss and chlorine activation can be studied with high-resolution measurements that have very good spatial and temporal coverage inside the Antarctic vortex. Previous satellite measurements were relatively limited to a small temporal and spatial area as far as high-latitude observations are concerned (e.g., Tilmes et al., 2006; Hoppel et al., 2005). While the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite MLS (Waters et al., 1999) had a similar latitudinal coverage, the frequency of its polar measurements was lower than that of Aura MLS (e.g., Livesey et al., 2013; Froidevaux et al., 2008). Therefore, the study with high-resolution simulations (both horizontally and vertically) together with the high-resolution",{"entities":[[1813,1817,"SPACECRAFT"],[1818,1840,"INSTRUMENT"],[1842,1845,"INSTRUMENT"],[2413,2448,"SPACECRAFT"],[2449,2452,"INSTRUMENT"],[2574,2578,"SPACECRAFT"],[2579,2582,"INSTRUMENT"]]}]

It reasonably isolates deep convection from trailing high clouds in a complex convective system (Sassen & Wang, 2008); thus, it is useful data for capturing overshooting convection. Only proles classied as deep convection is used for this study. Due to its frequent sampling, horizontal resolution of the cloud sample is ~1 km along track. We dene separate events of deep convection by connecting CloudSat samples located within 100 km along the orbit track. To avoid overlap between deep convection samples (i.e., sampling the same system multiple times), we further thin out the samples to have distance between separate events larger than 1,000 km. Among these data we focus on deep convection groups with maximum cloud top higher than 17 km. The selection method is utilized to avoid duplicated use of the dense along-track observations, and overall results are not sensitive to the selection criteria. One relevant aspect of the CloudSat sampling is that measurements are made near local times of 1:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. and hence probably undersample extreme convection over land where a large diurnal cycle occurs, with extreme convection in late afternoon (Liu & Zipser, 2008).",{"entities":[[473,481,"SPACECRAFT"],[1010,1018,"SPACECRAFT"]]}]

["Abstract. A three-dimensional (3-D) chemical transport model (CTM), SLIMCAT, has been used to quantify the effect of denitrication on ozone loss for the Arctic winter 2004/2005. The simulated HNO3 is found to be highly sensitive to the polar stratospheric cloud (PSC) scheme used in the model. Here the standard SLIMCAT full chemistry model, which uses a thermodynamic equilibrium PSC scheme, overpredicts the ozone loss for Arctic winter 2004/2005 due to the overestimation of denitrication and stronger chlorine activation than observed. A model run with a coupled detailed microphysical denitrication scheme, DLAPSE (Denitrication by Lagrangian Particle Sedimentation), is less denitried than the standard model run and better reproduces the observed HNO3 as measured by Airborne SUbmillimeter Radiometer (ASUR) and Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) instruments. Overall, denitrication is responsible for a 30 % enhancement in O3 depletion compared with simulations without denitrication for Arctic winter 2004/2005, which is slightly larger than the inferred impact of denitrication on Arctic ozone loss for previous winters from different CTMs simulations. The overestimated denitrication from standard SLIMCAT simulation causes 510 % more ozone loss at 17 km compared with the simulation using the DLAPSE PSC scheme for Arctic winter 2004/2005. The calculated partial column ozone loss from SLIMCAT using the DLAPSE scheme is about 130 DU by mid-March 2005, which compares well with the inferred column ozone loss from ozonesondes and satellite data (12721 DU).",{"entities":[[774,807,"INSTRUMENT"],[809,813,"INSTRUMENT"],[819,823,"SPACECRAFT"],[824,846,"INSTRUMENT"],[848,851,"INSTRUMENT"]]}]

Comparing to Measurements Of Pollution In The Troposphere (MOPITT) and MODIS observations, the MOZART4 model outputs show a high bias for the columnintegrated CO over South America and a low bias for AOT in the nearby oceanic regions [Emmons et al., 2010]. Since the species O3 in the MOZART4 is unrealistic in the stratosphere and upper troposphere [Emmons et al., 2010], the species O3RAD (instead of O3) in the MOZART4 is used for the initial and boundary conditions of O3 in the WRFChem simulations. The O3RAD variable is relaxed to the ozone climatology in the stratosphere and to the MOZART calculated ozone in the troposphere. It should be noticed that the O3RAD in the upper troposphere is much higher than observations due to too strong stratospheric flux from reanalysis meteorological data sets [van Noije et al., 2004; Emmons et al., 2010].",{"entities":[[875,880,"INSTRUMENT"]]}]

["Temperature data from the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) are used to estimate wavenumber and period of planetary waves during SSW. MLS is a limb scanning emission microwave radiometer on the NASA Aura satellite (Waters et al., 2006; Livesey et al., 2007). Aura was launched on July 15, 2004 on a sunsynchronous polar orbit at 705 km altitude with a 981 inclination. The MLS instrument scans the limb in the orbital plane which gives a global coverage from 821S to 821N on each orbit. The limb scans are made in the forward direction of the satellite. The useful height range of temperature data is approximately 897 km (3160.001 hPa) with a vertical resolution of  4 km in the stratosphere and  14 km at the mesopause determined by the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the averaging kernels (Livesey et al., 2007). Here we use the temperature data from the level 2 version 2.2 data product. We removed poor data by screening methodologies described by Livesey et al. (2007). The geometric altitudes are approximately calculated from the pressure levels as follows: h  7  lnp=1000, where h is the altitude in km and p the pressure in hPa.

Lebo and Seinfeld (2011) state that the aerosol-induced effect is controlled by the balance between latent heating and the increase in condensed water aloft, each having opposing effects on buoyancy.

The regularization matrix smooths the retrievals using an empirically determined height-dependent smoothing parameter, chosen in order to minimize physically unrealistic oscillations in proles while maximizing vertical resolution.

["[38] The rising Aura/MLS N2O mixing ratios are interpreted as ascent of the vortex in the vortex descent study above. The Odin/SMR N2O mixing ratios do on the other hand not rise in late February so the Odin/SMR vortex descent study does not indicate any vortex ascent in that period. Furthermore, the cross-isentropic transport rates from the SLIMCAT model corroborate the Odin/SMR descent rates and do not indicate vortex ascent in late February. Since the vertical gradients of Aura/MLS N2O mixing ratios inside the vortex drop more rapidly as a function of altitude after mid-February than in the early winter, the rising N2O mixing ratios in the lower vortex could possibly be explained by increased exchange of air masses across the vortex border at low altitudes. For this explanation to be true, the cross vortex border exchange would however have had to be stronger than seen in the passive DIAMOND model and it is furthermore not corroborated by the Odin/SMR N2O measurements.

(2007) where ozone and temperature observations of the seven SHADOZ station closest to the equator (see subpanel in Fig. 2 for their geographical position) are considered, but instead of pressure we use potential temperature as the vertical coordinate. In particular, p-related observations of each station are transformed to -levels using the measured temperatures and then averaged over all seven stations for each level. A clear annual cycle of O3/hO3i, with the highest values of O3/hO3i in late summer and early fall in the range between 370 and 430 K, can be diagnosed from the SHADOZ data. The lowest values appear approximately 4 5 months earlier. The pattern of this very pronounced cycle is similar to the analysis on the p-levels (Chae and Sherwood, 2007; Randel et al., 2007), although O3/hO3i is signicantly smaller with peak anomaly 0.5 versus 0.3 during summer by using p and  as the vertical coordinate, respectively (Fueglistaler et al., 2009a; Konopka et al., 2009). As discussed by Konopka et al.

The seasonality of O3 above the level of zero clear sky radiation (Q=0 level around 360 K as discussed in Gettelman et al., 2004) was recently explained as a consequence of the annual cycle in the tropical upwelling with the strongest and weakest upwelling in winter and summer, respectively (Randel et al., 2007).

["Chemical ozone loss in the Arctic stratosphere has been observed since 1989. Since then, cold winters are prone to large chemical ozone loss due to the still high amounts of ozone depleting substances in the atmosphere (Rex et al., 2004). However, because of large planetary wave activity, the polar vortex breaks up or dissipates early in most Arctic winters (WMO, 2011; Harris et al., 2010; Kuttippurath et al., 2010b; Manney et al., 2003). Therefore, the vortex persistence has been comparatively shorter and the associated ozone loss smaller in the Arctic as compared to the Antarctic (WMO, 2011; Solomon et al., 2007). The longest vortex persistence in the Arctic was found in 1996/1997, in which the wave activity was considerably suppressed, and therefore the vortex was sustained until early May (Lef`evre et al., 1998; Coy et al., 1997). Nevertheless, the ozone loss in 1996/1997 was lower than that of other cold winters such as 1994/1995, 1999/2000, and 2004/2005 due to relatively higher temperatures in DecemberFebruary 1996/1997, when chlorine activation plays a key role in determining the magnitude of ozone loss (Manney et al., 2003; Santee et al., 1997).

["[11] Figure 1 shows the zonal and temporal dependence of the NLC occurrence rate (Figure 1a) and the temperature fluctuations at 85 km (Figure 1b) for the period June 9  June 24, 2005. This period was chosen, because it is one with the most obvious quasi 5-day wave signature in the NLC occurrence rates. Both panels show a clear westward propagating (i.e., occurrence rate maxima and minima propagate from east to west) wave signature of wavenumber 1 (i.e., the zonal variation on a given day corresponds to one 2p cycle of a sine wave) and a period of about 5 days. Therefore, the signature corresponds to the quasi 5-day wave, or the symmetric Rossby (1, 1) normal mode oscillation. Temperature minima coincide with maxima in the NLC occurrence rate and vice versa. The excellent agreement between the wave signature in the NLC occurrence rates and the mesopause temperature fluctuations suggests that the quasi 5-day wave signature in the temperature field is the main driver for the NLC wave signature. The temperature fluctuations show maximum quasi 5-day wave amplitudes of about 3 K. Note, that the actual temperature amplitude at 85 km may differ from the observed one, because of the rather poor vertical resolution of the MLS temperature profiles near the mesopause (12  15 km). [12] Figure 2 shows the temporal evolution of the NLC occurrence rates for the [120, 90] longitude bin and illustrates that the quasi 5-day wave can have a very large impact on the NLC occurrence rates for a certain geographical location.

["However, deep convection may play an opposite role on SWV by modulating the thermal structure of the TTL (e.g., Randel et al., 2015). In the tropics, a localized temperature minimum is frequently observed over active convection (e.g., Gettelman et al., 2002; Holloway & Neelin, 2007; Johnson & Kriete, 1982). Particularly, the cold anomaly is generally observed near the cold-point tropopause (CPT) as a thin layer lasting a couple of weeks in boreal winter (Kim & Son, 2012; Paulik & Birner, 2012). This tropopause-level cooling may dehydrate the lower stratosphere in a signicant manner because it makes the CPT colder, and air parcels generally travel for a couple of weeks near the CPT before they enter into the lower stratosphere (e.g., Fueglistaler et al., 2005).",{"entities":[]}]

["Finally, as mentioned, we note that two major SSW occurred in the Northern Hemisphere in January 2006 and January 2009 (a major warming being dened as a reversal of the winds at 10 hPa at a latitude of 60). It is known that major SSW can have dampening effect on planetary waves at high latitudes. In particular, it has been observed that planetarywave amplitudes can be suppressed after major SSW events (e.g. Alexander and Shepherd, 2010). If the ducting hypothesis is correct, then the MLT summer-time wave originates in the winter hemisphere and so any changes in wave amplitude due to major SSW may be reected in reduced wave amplitudes in the summer MLT of the opposite hemisphere. To see if such effects are present in our analysis, we examined the UKMO stratospheric winds and temperatures at 10 hPa to characterise the two major SSW.

Firstly, the ozone information comes from IR channels that have a signicant sensitivity to clouds and surface emission. Thus errors in the detection of cloud contamination and the characterization for surface emissivity and skin temperature can potentially undermine the useful ozone signal in the data. Secondly, the observed radiances and the radiative transfer (RT) model used in the interpretation of the observations are both prone to biases. This problem is of course not unique to ozone-sensitive data and applies to all radiance observations.
