# IMaSC

Intelligent Mission and Scientific Instrument Classification. Applying unique NLP approaches to improve information extraction through scientific papers/Foundry A-Team Studies.

## The Data

Available datasets can be found in the `data` directory. The `microwave_limb_sounder` dataset contains a data dump of data from an Elasticsearch index, which contains documents with their parsed text ([PDFMiner](https://github.com/euske/pdfminer) was used to extract text from the PDF documents). The dataset also contains some, but not all, source PDFs. There are `1109` JSON documents but only `604` PDFs. The PDFs could be used with an altetrnative means of text extraction if desired and new machine-readable data generated for use in modeling.

### Generating datasets

To generate training, validation, and testing sets, run 'parser.py' with default inputs. This will generate the three files `training_set.jsonl` , `validation_set.jsonl` , and `testing_set.jsonl` in the
`data/microwave_limb_sounder` directory.

### Using Prodigy

Prodigy will allow you to annotate your datasets. Please note that my Prodigy wheel installation path is specific to my laptop in `requirements.txt` at this time.

* To start Prodigy, run `prodigy ner.manual name_of_dataset name_of_model ./path/to/dataset.jsonl --label INSTRUMENT,SPACECRAFT` in the `IMaSC` directory.
    - In my case I ran `prodigy ner.manual train_imasc en_core_web_sm ./data/microwave_limb_sounder/training_set.jsonl --label INSTRUMENT,SPACECRAFT` .
* From there, open a browser and enter [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) in

the search bar. Prodigy should be running on port 8080 by default.

* To annotate text, click on the annotation you wish to apply and highlight the text you wish to annotate.

Prodigy will automatically apply the annotation.

* To remove an annotation, hover over the top left corner of an existing annotation

and click the "X".

* Once you have finished annotating a piece of text (you may not need to annotate anything),

click the green check mark. If a piece of text is not appropriate for annotation,
click the grey no symbol to skip it.

* You can also click the grey return to undo an annotation.

* To export annotations as a JSONL, run `prodigy db-out train_imasc > ./annotations.jsonl`.

#### What to label

Currently, IMaSC supports labeling of scientific instruments (i.e. `MLS` ) and the spacecraft (i.e. `Aura satellite` ) that carry them.
Using the directions above, label all instances of scientific instruments and spacecraft in the text.

#### Training

Train the model with the following command: `prodigy ner.batch-train train_imasc en_core_web_sm -n 100`. To train a model with only one entity type run `prodigy ner.batch-train train_imasc en_core_web_sm -n 100 -l ENTITY`.
A flowchart for how to train your specific model can be found [here](https://prodi.gy/prodigy_flowchart_ner-36f76cffd9cb4ef653a21ee78659d366.pdf). About 4000 annotations are needed to train the model.
