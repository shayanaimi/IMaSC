# IMaSC

Intelligent Mission and Scientific Instrument Classification. Applying unique NLP approaches to improve information extraction through scientific papers/Foundry A-Team Studies.

## The Data

Available datasets can be found in the `data` directory. The `microwave_limb_sounder` dataset contains a data dump of data from an Elasticsearch index, which contains documents with their parsed text ([PDF Miner](https://github.com/euske/pdfminer) was used to extract text from the PDF documents). The dataset also contains some, but not all, source PDFs. There are `1109` JSON documents but only `604` PDFs. The PDFs could be used with an altetrnative means of text extraction if desired and new machine-readable data generated for use in modeling.

### Generating datasets

To generate training, validation, and testing sets, run 'parser.py' with default inputs. This will generate the three files `training_set.jsonl`, `validation_set.jsonl`, and `testing_set.jsonl` in the 
`data/microwave_limb_sounder` directory.

### Using Prodigy

Prodigy will allow you to annotate your datasets. 
- To start Prodigy, run `prodigy ner.manual name_of_dataset name_of_model ./path/to/dataset.jsonl --label INSTRUMENTS,SPACECRAFT` in the `IMaSC` directory. 
    - In my case I ran `prodigy ner.manual train_imasc en_core_web_sm ./data/microwave_limb_sounder/training_set.jsonl --label INSTRUMENT,SPACECRAFT`
- From there, open a browser and enter [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) in 
the search bar. Prodigy should be running on port 8080 by default.
- To annotate text, click on the annotation you wish to apply and highlight the text you wish to annotate. 
Prodigy will automatically apply the annotation. 
- To remove an annotation, hover over the top left corner of an existing annotation 
and click the "X".
- Once you have finished annotating a piece of text (you may not need to annotate anything), 
click the green check mark. If a piece of text is not appropriate for annotation, 
click the grey no symbol to skip it.
- You can also click the grey return to undo an annotation.

#### What to label

Currently, IMaSC supports labeling of scientific instruments (i.e. `MLS`) and the spacecraft (i.e. `Aura satellite`) that carry them. 
Using the directions above, label all instances of scientific instruments and spacecraft in the text.
